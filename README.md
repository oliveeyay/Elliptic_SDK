============

An elliptic cryptographic library coded in java; open source under GPL v3 license.
Elliptic curve : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve
Cryptography usind elliptic curves : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography


You can find some examples of use for this library in the file main.java :
- a Diffie Hellman test (key exchange process using the Diffie Hellman algorithm)
- a El Gamal test (encryption/decryption using the El Gamal algorithm)
- a signature test, which is not compliant sometimes ! Need to be fixed in future versions


Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question on this software.
